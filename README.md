# OpenDaylight Sample Apps

This project contains various applications that can be used with OpenDaylight (https://www.opendaylight.org/).
OpenDaylight is an open source controller for softrware defined networking (SDN).

These sample applications run on top of an OpenDaylight controller. They are NOT intended for upstream contribution into the OpenDaylight project. They are meant to:

* Help the the Cisco DevNet developer community learn how to use OpenDaylight and create applications that run on top of it
* Illustrate how to use various OpenDaylight APIs and interfaces
* Serve as starter applications for Cisco DevNet hackathons, etc.

Each application exists in its own subdirectory. Each application may have its own [README](./README.md), [LICENSE](./LICENSE), [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md), and [AUTHORS](./AUTHORS) file, otherwise the ones in this project level directory apply.
